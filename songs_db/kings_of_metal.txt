Manowar - Kings of Metal

Manowar Manowar living on the road
When we're in town speakers explode
We don't attract wimps 'cause we're too loud
Just true metal people that's Manowar's crowd
They want to keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burning
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
Other bands play Manowar kill
We like it hard, we like it fast
We got the biggest amps, man they blast
True metal people want to rock not pose
Wearing jeans and leather, not cracker jack clothes
They want to keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burning
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
Other bands play Manowar kill
We're the kings of metal coming to town
When we light up, have the roof nailed down
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud
'Cause there ain't no way that we'll ever turn down
They want to keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burning
We always will
